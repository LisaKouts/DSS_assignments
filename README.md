### Lisa Koutsoviti | TiU MSc Data Science Society | Assignments

This repository contains three assignments and a master thesis that were made as part of courses of the MSc Data Science and Society, Department of Humanities and Digital Sciences at Tilburg University. The pdf files include a description of our experiments and results including features used, learning models and algorithm, parameter tuning and references.

- Master Thesis: Bias quantification measures based onfuzzy rough sets

Abstract: The need to measure bias in pattern classification datasets has gained wide recognition in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The research community calls for the introduction of new bias measures as existing ones are highly context specific. This thesis proposes five new model-independent measures to quantify bias using the fuzzy-rough set theory. The intuition behind them is that protected features should not change the fuzzy-rough set regions significantly. The extent to which this happens is considered to be a proxy for bias quantification. The advantages of the proposed measures are that (i) they do not depend on any black-box prediction model but on a distance function, (ii) they offer an intuitive rationale, and (iii) they introduce the novel notion of uncertainty in decision-making as a proxy for bias. The proposed measures are tested on two datasets and compared to popular group fainress literature measures. The results showed that the proposed measures differ from the literature measures in terms of both trend and magnitude. This suggests that a fuzzy-rough set based approach might capture bias better than current state-of-the-art approaches.

- Assignment 1: Machine Learning Challenge

  This is a mandatory group-assignment that was created for the course Machine Learning during the spring semester of 2020. Team members were Mantas M., Hyun Seon P. and myself. Grade received was 9.5/10 which was worth 30% of the final grade. Achieved accuracy was 11%. We were among the first ten groups (out of 48 in total) that achieved the highest level of accuracy. 

  In this assignment there were two separate tasks. The first task (multiclass classification) was to train a model to recognize handwritten English letters (124800 images and labels, 4800 different images per label.

  In the second task (multilabel classification) we had to use the classifiers trained in the first task to identify a series of 5 letters in an image of size 30 × 150. These images were noisy. Example: The label for the first image is ‘2118161513’. The letters in the image are: ‘urpom’. We had to encode/decode the label as: u = 21, r = 18, p=16, o=15, m=13. We had to submit a csv file containing 5 predicted labels per image based on a probability distribution over the 26 letters.

- Assignment 2: Deep Learning 

  This is a mandatory group-assignment that was created for the course Deep Learning during the winter semester of 2020. Team members were Agapi V., Hyun Seon P. and myself. Grade received was 8.5/10 which was worth 30% of the final grade. The task was predicting whether an English sentence is an original English text or a (human) translation from French into English (classification). The provided data had been balanced. The final accuracy achieved was 77.35% (7th highest out of 54 groups). 

  The data provided consists of transcribed English speech. Some of these sentences were originally uttered in English (label 0), others were originally uttered in French and then translated by a human translator into English (label 1).

- Assignment 3: 

  This is a mandatory group-assignment that was created for the course Programming with R during the winter semester of 2020. Team members were Vira H., Trang L., Sue Y., Jennifer Z.L. and myself. Grade received was 10/10 which was worth 30% of the final grade. The teams had to chose a dataset and a reasearch topic and write a short research paper using R software environment. 
  
  We attempted to predict song popularity based on Kaggle’s Spotify dataset (Singh, 2020). We had to preprocess the data (cleaning, EDA) and fit models using the knn and logistic regression classifiers. Main packages used were dplyr, ggplot2 and caret. The highest accuracy score was 64% using logistic regression on the full set of attributes.
